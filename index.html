            <h2>About Axolotls</h2>

            <p>Axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) are unique amphibians native to lakes around Mexico City. Known for their ability to regenerate limbs, they are often called the "Mexican walking fish" (although they're not fish!).</p>

            <h2>Natural Habitat</h2>

            <p>Axolotls are found in the lakes and canals of Xochimilco, a region near Mexico City. They thrive in freshwater environments with cool, stable temperatures and lots of underwater plants.</p>

            <h2>Axolotl Care Tips</h2>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Tank Size:</strong> At least 20 gallons for one axolotl.</li>

                <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Keep between 60-64°F (16-18°C) to mimic their natural environment.</li>

                <li><strong>Water Quality:</strong> Clean, filtered water is essential; avoid strong currents.</li>

                <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Axolotls eat worms, small fish, and special axolotl pellets.</li>

            <ul> 
        
                <li>1. Neotenic Marvels - Axolotls retain their larval features throughout their lives, a condition known as neoteny. Unlike other amphibians, they keep their external gills and remain aquatic. </li>

                <li>2. Regenerative Superpowers - They can regenerate not only limbs but also parts of their heart, lungs, and even sections of their brain without scarring!</li>

                <li>3. Unique Habitat - They’re native to Lake Xochimilco and Lake Chalco in Mexico City, which are shrinking due to urbanization. In the wild, they are critically endangered.</li>

                <li>4. Wide Range of Colors - Axolotls come in various colors, including wild-type (dark brown/black), albino, leucistic (pale with pinkish features), and even rare variations like melanoid and golden.</li>

                <li>5. Perpetual Smile - Axolotls appear to “smile” due to the shape of their mouths, giving them a perpetually cheerful appearance.</li>

                <li>6. Big Appetite - They're carnivorous, feeding on worms, insects, small fish, and sometimes other amphibians. In captivity, they love earthworms and brine shrimp.</li>

                <li>7. Symbol of Mexican Culture - The axolotl is an important cultural symbol in Mexico, representing resilience and transformation, linked to the Aztec god Xolotl.</li>

                <li>8. Nocturnal Lifestyle - Axolotls are primarily active at night, using their sense of smell and lateral line system to hunt in murky waters.</li>

                <li>9. Research Heros - Scientists study axolotls extensively to understand regeneration, which may lead to breakthroughs in human medicine.</li>

                <li>10. Rare Metamorphosis - Although they usually stay in their larval form, they can metamorphose into adult salamanders under certain conditions, such as hormone treatment, though this shortens their lifespan.</li>

                <li>These little “water monsters” are not only adorable but also incredible biological wonders!</li>
